# Analog Clock App
This project is built on the side of my Codecademy full-stack career path as a compliment to the course about DOM that I recently completed. I felt like needed a challenge and some repetition, hence the creation of this application that really shouldn't be used for anything.

## How to use
Just open up the index.html file in your browser and make sure to have JavaScript enabled.

## Want to build onto the project?
### CSS alternatives
+ Try using TailwindCSS instead of pure CSS.
+ Try making the CSS code in SASS in order to write fewer lines and to try out another technology.
+ And more...

### JS alternatives
+ Try making this site in Vue/React/Angular
+ Write some kind of event handling, for instance, what if the time is shown as digital while the clock is being pressed down at with your mouse.
+ Make another kind of clock, a Pomodoro clock for instance.
